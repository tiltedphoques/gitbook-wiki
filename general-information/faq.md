# FAQ

### Q: what is Skyrim Together Reborn?

A: Skyrim Together is a mod that aims to bring co-op to Skyrim. Skyrim Together Reborn is basically the "sequel" to the old Skyrim Together (which some of you may know as "Harbor Edition", "Nightlies", or simply "Old ST"). The code has been rewritten from the ground up, since the old codebase was too messy to work with. This decision has paid off big time, since Skyrim Together Reborn is _significantly_ better than old Skyrim Together. Check the sidebar for the list of features.

### Q: what platforms and versions are supported?

A: the **ONLY** version that is supported, and will most likely ever be supported, is Skyrim Special Edition on Steam, particularly version 1.6. The modding community has mislabeled this as "Anniversary Edition". Anniversary Edition is the combo package of Special Edition and the Anniversary Upgrade. You do not need this to play Skyrim Together Reborn. You only need to buy Special Edition.

VR, console, legendary edition (aka oldrim) and the gamepass version are not and will never be supported.

### Q: where can I report bugs and request features?

A: you can submit bugs and feature requests at our code repository [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution/issues).

### Q: what is the recommended amount of players?

A: while we do not have a hard player count limit in theory, for the best experience, we recommend that you play with 2 to 8 people.

### Q: what is the current status of Fallout Together?

A: when developing Skyrim Together Reborn, the developers decided to make the mod work with Fallout 4 too. At the start of 2022, we decided to focus on Skyrim Together Reborn entirely due to time constraints and the small size of the team. We said that we would finish Fallout Together after Skyrim Together Reborn was released.

There is currently only one developer on the team who is interested in finishing Fallout Together (see [Q: will the mod get future updates?](https://wiki.tiltedphoques.com/tilted-online/general-information/faq#q-will-the-mod-get-future-updates)). Even for this developer, this is most likely too big a task. If Fallout Together is to be completed, more developers need to pitch in. We hope that going open source brings in more people to help with that.

### Q: can I use other mods with this mod?

A: our official stance is that, for the best, most stable experience, you should not install other mods. You still absolutely can, and our mod also automatically loads SKSE if you have it installed, but we cannot make any guarantees that these mods won't cause stability issues, play nice with our systems, or that their features will sync. This is up to your discretion. We consider Creation Club mods to fall under this same category, including the Anniversary Upgrade mod pack.

We did not build Reborn with the Anniversary Upgrade mod pack in mind. For the most stable experience, you should disable the mods that come with the paid Anniversary Upgrade mod pack.
{% endhint %}

### Q: will X mod work with this mod?

A: we do not know which mods work well with our mods. No mods are explicitly synced. Mods only sync accidentally. The only way to know whether a mod syncs is by testing it. Graphics mods usually work fine. Other than that, it's hard to tell. Our mod loads SKSE automatically if you have it installed. We have a mod tracker where you can check and submit compatibility of mods, which can be found [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/Mod-Compatibility). There are a few mods that are blocked by us, since they are inherently incompatible:

* Engine fixes
* Skyrim Souls RE
* Fraps (not a mod, but also blocked)

### Q: will the mod get future updates?

A: Skyrim Together Reborn 1.0 is a solid base for a lot of future expansion. The current development team has put in a lot of work. Unfortunately, they cannot keep working at this pace. That is why the mod went open source. We hope that new developers come in to help this mod reach new heights. There is still lots of work that can be done, like building a scripting API, implementing features like weather sync, doing additional bug and crash fixes, making quests smoother, or finishing Fallout Together.

The current dev team will still be there to maintain the codebase, guide new developers, and build new features (if they feel like it).

### Q: is there some place where I can donate money to the project?

A: we currently do not take donations. This may change in the future.

### Q: what operating systems are supported?

A: for the mod itself you will need Windows 8.1 or higher. Linux support will be something that will have to be done by the community on our GitHub. The server runs on both Windows and Linux.

### Q: what is Tilted Online?

A: Tilted Online is the name of the codebase of both Skyrim Together Reborn and Fallout Together.
