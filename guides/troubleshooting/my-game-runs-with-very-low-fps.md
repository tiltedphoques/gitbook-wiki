# My game runs with very low FPS

### Q: Normally my game runs fine, but when launching through `SkyrimTogether.exe` the performance is terrible

This usually happens in laptops, or in systems where the CPU has an integrated graphics unit built in. The fix is to set your system to use your dedicated graphics card, and not your iGPU.

**A:** Go in your `NVIDIA Control Panel` and select your Graphics Card as your main processor.

**A:** In Windows 11, you can actually choose this processor in `Systems --> Display --> Graphics` and then finding SkyrimSE and selecting `Options` and then `High performance`
