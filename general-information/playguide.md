# Playguide

### How and when to connect

Do **NOT** connect to a server while you are still doing the Helgen intro quest. You should **ONLY** connect after escaping Helgen. To open the UI, either use the Right-CTRL key or the F2 key.

### Mods

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend you play without any other mods installed for optimal gameplay. If you do, it's on your own precaution.

[Mods may or may not work as explained in the FAQ.](faq.md)

### Questing

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you want an optimal questing experience with the least amount of bugs, crashes and desyncs, read the questing section carefully (especially the guidelines).
{% endhint %}

#### How does it work?

The quest sync system works through the party system. When you create a party, you are the party leader. The party leader basically "hosts" the majority of the world. Other party members should be seen as "guests" in the world of the party leader. Whenever the party leader gets or progresses a quest, the other party members also get or progress their quests automatically. Note that this does not apply to miscellaneous quests.

#### Guidelines

To have an optimal questing experience, you should follow these 4 rules:

1. Only the party leader can talk to quest NPCs to progress quests, and should be the only one to interact with quest scenes (like warding against a firebolt in the "First Lessons" quest).
2. Only the party leader can loot quest items, like the golden claw.
3. Stick to one party leader per **playthrough**, not per session. Changing party leaders will probably break the current quests you're doing, and it might break quests after that.
4. Stick to one party per server. More parties are technically possible, but it is not recommended if you want to do a quest-heavy playthrough, since they might interfere with each other.

#### What _can_ you do as a party member?

These are some things you can safely do if you are not the party leader (though the party leader should be present for these things):

* Kill quest monsters and bosses.
* Clear quest dungeons.
* Do quest puzzles.
* Accidentally starting a quest as a non-leader is not a problem, just make sure you do not progress the quest until the leader has also taken that quest.

#### What if you get stuck?

In case you get stuck, you can either reload an older save, or use the quest debugger as the party leader. The quest debugger menu can be opened through the debug UI overlay by pressing "**F3**" then Press "F2" to show the cursor. This menu can be used to progress a quest stage or teleport quest NPCs to you. Be warned that using the quest debugger might cause the quest to be skipped entirely.

### Saving

It is recommended that you save often, and that you leave auto saving enabled, especially before scripted events and before finishing a quest. You can use F5 to quicksave.

### Debugger menu

Press "**F3**" to open the debugger menu. This special UI has menus that can help you get unstuck, either as your character or quests, join a server, start/join a party, etc. The debug UI can be closed by pressing F3 again.
