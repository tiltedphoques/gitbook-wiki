# Creating a MO2 profile

Now we need to setup MO2 properly.

## Creating a new profile

1. Find this icon in the top menu <img src="https://sxcu.net/5BEuPZp6d.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and press it. It should say `Configure profiles` when hovering it. This will open a new window.
2. Press `Create` and name your profile what you want. In this tutorial we'll go with `Skyrim Together Reborn`.
3. Remove the `âœ“` from the `Use profile-specific Game INI files` and then press `No` on the popup with the title `Delete profile specific game INI files?`
4. Press your newly created `Skyrim Together Reborn` profile and press the `Select` button.
5. So far so good!

Now we have a separate profile that we can mess around with.
