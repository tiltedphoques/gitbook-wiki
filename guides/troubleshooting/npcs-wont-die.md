# NPCs won't die



### Q: When we kill NPCs, they won't die

**A:** You can use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13395) that disables killcams, killmoves and killbites. That has worked for some people. You should probably download the ESL version, since the `esm`/`esp`/`esl` mods [theoretically](https://shx.is/5BnIBau51.png) have a better chance of working.
