# Removing the old setup

## Uninstalling the game

Perhaps you haven't even installed Skyrim Special Edition (SkyrimSE), but we'll need to double-check.

Begin by uninstalling your game from the Steam application:

1. Open Steam
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right click and select `Manage -> Uninstall`
4. Find your Skyrim installation folder. That can vary, but usally it's located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`
5. Delete the entire `Skyrim Special Edition` folder.

## Removing old game profile(s) and savegames

Let's empty the folder containing all of your config files and savegames. Back them up and put them back in the folder if you care about them. Let us remove them for the time being.

1. Go to your `Documents` folder.
2. Find your `My Games` folder.
3. Delete the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder
4. The folder can usually be found at `C:\Users\YOUR-USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition`
5. Obviously replace the `YOUR-USERNAME` part with your own Windows username.

### **Notes:**

* If you use Steam Cloud, your savegames should be automatically uploaded to the Steam Cloud. When you restart SkyrimSE, Steam should re-download them.
* However, if you don't trust Steam Cloud or are unsure whether you've enabled it, make a manual backup of the `My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` folder.

#### Onwards to the next step!
