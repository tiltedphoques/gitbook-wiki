# Creating a separator in MO2

Now we are going to create a separator in MO2. This is nice for getting an overview of your setup.

The only function is for separating mods from other mods. It's like homemade categories.

Since we don't need many, if even any, mods, we'll just create one separator.

But if you want to add more separators (to sort other mods), you can do so yourself.

## Creating a separator

1. Open MO2
2. Make sure to select the profile "Skyrim Together Reborn" that we created earlier.
3. ![](https://shx.is/5BiQKJGiF.png)
4. Right-click in some empty area below the mods, and select `Create separator`
5. Name it `Utilities` and press Enter.

#### Onwards to the next step!
