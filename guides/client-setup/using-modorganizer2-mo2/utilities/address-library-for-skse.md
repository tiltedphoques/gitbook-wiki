Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is **NOT** required to play Skyrim Together Reborn!

Despite the fact that the mod's name is `Address Library for SKSE`, we don't actually need SKSE installed.

However, in order for Skyrim Together Reborn to work, we must first install this mod.

## Downloading and installing Address Library

1. Head to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files), find the `All in one (Anniversary Edition)` version and press `Mod Manager Download`
2. ![](https://sxcu.net/5BiWbFFPM.png)
3. Your MO2 should now launch and download the mod.
4. To the right in MO2, there should be a tab named ![](https://sxcu.net/5BiX5nxYS.png). Click it!
5. In there will be the mod we just downloaded. Right-click on it and select `Install`
6. ![](https://sxcu.net/5BiXi9HK3.png)
7. Press `OK` on the popup
8. Press the empty box, so there's a `âœ“` in the `Address Library for SKSE Plugins`

10. Nice! That should be it for now.

#### Onwards to the next step!
