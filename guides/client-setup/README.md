# Client setup

## **Prerequisites**

Here's a short list of what you need to get completely up and running.

You need:

1. A **legal** copy of `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition` on Steam, **atleast** version 1.6.XX. No, it [doesn't work](../../general-information/supported-games.md) with anything below v1.6.XX.
2. A NexusMods account. Create one [here](https://users.nexusmods.com/register) if you don't have an account. It's completely free!
3. Some kind of archiving tool. I use [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/), but a lot of people use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com).
4. A lot of patience and a calm mind. You shouldn't rush through this. Take it easy. Grab a cup of tea, and enjoy.
