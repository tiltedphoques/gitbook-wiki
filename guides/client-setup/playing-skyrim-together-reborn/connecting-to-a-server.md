# Connecting to a server

### Using the Skyrim Together Reborn UI (STRUI)

1. Now that we're out of the cave, we want to connect to a Skyrim Together Reborn server.
2. You can use either `F2` or `Right-CTRL` to open up the Skyrim Together Reborn UI. The guide will refer to it as the `STRUI` from now on.
3. Open up the `STRUI` by pressing either `F2` or `Right-CTRL`.
4. Press the `Connect` button to start connecting to a server

### Connecting to a server

1. When you press connect, you can enter your server's connection information.
2. There will be an `Address` field and a `Password` field.
3. In the `Address` field, you should put your server's public IPv4 address in there + the default port `10578`.
4. If you're just hosting it locally, that ip address + the port will be `127.0.0.1:10578`
5. If you're hosting a server for other players, you can find your public IPv4 address by using a website like [this](https://icanhazip.com/) or [this](https://ipinfo.io/) or [this](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
6. Press `Connect` to connect to your server, and there should be a visual and an audial confirmation that you're connected.

7\. It should say `Succesfully connected to a server` in the little chat window

8\. Now you should be connected and ready to play Skyrim Together Reborn with your friends :thumbsup:

#### **Notes:**

1. If you `ALT-TAB` out and back in, it might get stuck. Press either `F2` or `Right-CTRL` to close it and then re-open it again.
2. If it gets stuck, or doesn't want to close or re-open, you might need to restart the game.
3. If your connection times out, make sure the **server host** has forwarded the port `10578`. There's a decent guide on how to do it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExrSULINq9c).

### That's it for the client part of the guide.
