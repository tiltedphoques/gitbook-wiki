# Build guide

## Cloning the repository

The code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution).

Choose or create a directory for the repository to get cloned into, such as your Desktop. This is the directory we'll be working out of, so pick somewhere convenient. **Be aware that spaces in the path will not work!** For example `C:\dev\git_projects\TiltedEvolution` is fine but `C:\dev\git projects\TiltedEvolution` will **NOT** work.

Fork the repository through Github. Using the command line, run the following command in the directory from the previous step: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/[YourGithubName]/TiltedEvolution.git` . Replace \[YourGithubName] with your Github name.

Once the command has finished executing, you should have a copy of this repository named `TiltedEvolution` inside your project directory.

## Setting up the environment

### Requirements

You will need [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (the community edition is freely available for download) and [xmake](https://xmake.io/#/getting\_started) to build the project, as well as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for building the UI.

#### Installing Visual Studio 2022
Download Visual Studio 2022 from the official [webpage](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (the community edition is free). Follow the installation steps and when you reach the following screen, select the options "Desktop development with C++" and "Game development with C++".

### Generating the project files

Run `xmake project -k vsxmake` to generate `TiltedEvolution.sln` , the Visual Studio solution which we'll be using. This can now be found in the `vsxmake20**` folder. You can choose the build mode either in Visual Studio directly, or through the command line, `xmake config -m releasedbg` .

{% hint style="warning" %}
You MUST do this step every time you merge changes from the main repository to avoid conflicts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do NOT use the **debug** build for the client as it will ONLY work for the server. If you want to debug the client, use **releasedbg**.
{% endhint %}

### Building

The mod can either be compiled through Visual Studio, or through the command line, `xmake -y` . If all goes well, everything should now be compiled. Should you encounter any errors, feel free to ask for help in the Skyrim Together Discord **#coding** channel.

### Running and debugging

Building is the first step; once the project compiled successfully you will need to generate an install by running `xmake install -o distrib`, which will create a directory called `distrib` in the root path that contains all of the files needed to run. Copy the files in `distrib/bin` over to `build/windows/x64/releasedbg` . This step should only be performed once, when building the project for the first time.

In Visual Studio, set `FalloutImmversiveLauncher` or `SkyrimImmversiveLauncher` as the startup project and ensure you are in the dev branch. Hit `Local Windows Debugger` to start debugging. From `build/windows/x64/releasedbg` , you can launch the server executable and a second client if you wish.

### Building the Together UI

Until you've built and installed the Together UI, you will not have it in game (this does not include the debug UI). Open a shell inside `Code/skyrim_ui` and execute `npm install` . This will install the required packages.

Next, execute `npm run deploy:develop` to build the development version. Alternatively, execute `npm run deploy:production` to build the production version. Copy the folder `Code/skyrim_ui/dist/UI` over to `build/windows/x64/releasedbg` . Although not necessary, we recommend creating a symbolic link to the folder during development instead of duplicating to avoid having to copy over the folder after each build.

## Verifying

If everything worked as intended, a Tilted Reverse Console will pop up. Once loaded into a save, run the corresponding server executable (or script, if you created one). Press F3 to display the Dear ImGui debug UI on top of your game. You should now be able to connect in-game by using the UI in the top left corner; pressing RCTRL or F2 should free your mouse so that you're able to interact with the UI. Note that you must have the [Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files) mod manually installed to launch an instance of the game.

## Working in this repository

From now on, whenever you want to make a change in the repository, you will first need to branch off the master branch. Using a CLI in the `TiltedEvolution` directory, first check if the master branch is fully up to date:

```
git checkout master
git fetch
git pull
```

Now you can create a new branch. Please use the `feature-` prefix so that it's clear that your branch is a temporary, in-progress development branch. Creating your branch can be done using one of two methods:

### CLI

Simply enter `git checkout -b feature-somenamehere` to have a branch created for you.

### GitHub for Desktop

In the application, go to `Branch -> New branch...`. Give this an appropriate name (don't forget the prefix) and ensure that the branch is based on the `master` branch.

## Understanding the code

#### Project structure

When it comes to the actual code (located in `TiltedEvolution\Code`), the two primary folders of interest are `client` and `server`.

**Client** is the core of the mod and can be broken down into `Games`, `Services`, and `Systems`.

* `Games` contains all of the code that is Skyrim and Fallout 4 related, it mostly contains class structures and hooks to different parts of the engine
* `Services` contains the different services that handle the actual sync, display, and gameplay
* `Systems` contains specific tasks like interpolation and consuming animations

**Server** is the, well, server! It doesn't really contain much at the moment, it's a translation layer more than anything for the time being.

### Starting points

When getting started, a good place to begin is looking at the **DebugService** in `client\Services` as it demonstrates how to get a service to listen to update events and how to spawn a copy of yourself. It also displays a bunch of gameplay elements for which we have written debuggers.

## Afterword

And that's all! With that, you're on your way to making great contributions to the repository. As mentioned previously, if you have any questions or encounter any hurdles, feel free to use the **#coding** channel in the [Skyrim Together Discord](https://discord.gg/skyrimtogether)!
