## The firewall didn't popup! Help!

Because the guide is written using Windows 11, the UI will reflect that. I believe it is similar to Windows 10's UI.

5. Select `Inbound Rules`
6. Verify the rules have not been created before. If they **have** been created before, there will be two rules named `Multiplayer Server for Bethesda games`. If they are there, you can safely continue.
7. If they are not there, we will now create them manually.
8. To the right side of the `Windows Defender Firewall`, there'll be a button named ![](https://sxcu.net/5BzYyMbqm.png)
