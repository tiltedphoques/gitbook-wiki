# Before we begin

## A few notes before we begin playing!

1. Everytime you want to play Skyrim Together Reborn, you need to launch it through the custom launcher we created in MO2.
2. You should create a **NEW CHARACTER** the first time launching. My recommendation would be to **only** use that character when playing Skyrim Together Reborn.
3. You **NEED** to complete the first Helgen mission before even trying to connect. Else it'll end up badly for you, and you might need to start over, with a new savegame.
4. Expect bugs. Lots of bugs. This will not be a MMO-like smooth experience, where everything "just works". Remember, they're a team of volunteers doing this **for free** in their spare time.
5. If you want to help improve the mod, we are always looking for **C++ coders** for the mod and **Angular/TypeScript coders** for the UI of the mod. Head to their [Discord](https://discord.gg/skyrimtogether) and introduce yourself :thumbsup:
6. If you don't know how to code, but want to help anyways, please report your bugs and findings [here](https://github.com/tiltedphoques/TiltedEvolution/issues). Use the template, it's there for a reason. Be as thorough as possible, if you actually want to help fix the bug.

## How do I \_\_\_\_\_ with my friends?

Use the excellent [playguide here](../../../../general-information/playguide.md), and read it carefully. I don't want to explain the same things, when they've done it so well.

#### Onwards to the next step!
