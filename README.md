# Overview

We create multiplayer mods for Bethesda games. Currently, we only support Skyrim through Skyrim Together Reborn, but we plan to support Fallout 4 too. We aim to bring co-op to these games, meant for 2 to 8 players.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We are not a game development studio. We do not have any resources, our team mostly consists of students, we do all of this in our free time. If you want to support our efforts, check out the [TogetherTeam Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=79997498). All things considered, you should manage your expectations before jumping into one of our mods. **Our mods are not perfect.** They will occasionally crash, some quests will break, there will be bugs. This is not fixable. This is just the reality of making a multiplayer mod instead of having a massive studio like Bethesda make a multiplayer game. Still, it is playable and it is a lot of fun.
