# Connecting to your server

## How to connect to the server

This page is intended to show the host's friend how to connect to his or her server.

## **Installing ZeroTier**

It's actually quite easy. We only need to download the ZeroTier client.

1. Go to the download page, and select `Windows`.\

## Connecting to a server

1. When you press connect, you will need to enter your server's connection information.
2. There will be an `Address` field and a `Password` field.
3. In the `Address` field, you should put your server's public IPv4 address in there
4. If you're just hosting it locally, that ip address will be `127.0.0.1`
5. If you're hosting a server for other players, you can find your public IPv4 address by using a website like [this](https://icanhazip.com/) or [this](https://ipinfo.io/) or [this](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
6. Press `Connect` to connect to your server, and there should be a visual and an audial confirmation that you're connected.

7\. It should say `Succesfully connected to a server` in the little chat window

8\. Now you should be connected and ready to play Skyrim Together Reborn with your friends :thumbsup:

## **Notes:**

1. If you have any problems, take a look through the [Troubleshooting pages](../../../troubleshooting/) on this wiki.
2. If the troubleshooting pages were ineffective in helping you, you can always ask questions on the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/skyrimtogether).
3. If your connection times out, make sure you have ZeroTier open, on both the **server host** and on your PC.

#### That was it, for the ZeroTier server setup.
