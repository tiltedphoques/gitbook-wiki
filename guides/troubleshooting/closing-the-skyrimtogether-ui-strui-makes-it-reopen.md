# Closing the SkyrimTogether UI (STRUI) makes it reopen

### Q: When I'm trying to close the STRUI, it just reopens

**A:** Try and use the `F2` button instead of `Right CTRL`.

**A:** Reload your savegame, and/or restart your game if that doesn't work. Sometimes it takes multiple restarts.

**A:** You can also try deleting whatever's inside MO2's overwrite folder, located here:\
`C:\Modding\MO2\overwrite`
