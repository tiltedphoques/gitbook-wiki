# Locating the STServer.ini

## Locating the `STServer.ini` to configure our server

Now that our server is shut down and we've created the inbound firewall rules, we can look at the `STServer.ini` config file, which allows us to configure a few parameters.

## [Option 1: Using MO2](locating-the-stserver.ini.md#using-modorganizer2) | [Option 2: Using VMM](locating-the-stserver.ini.md#using-vortex-mod-manager)

### **Using ModOrganizer2**

1. Open MO2
2. Find the mod `Skyrim Together Reborn`
3. Right-click it, and select `Open in Explorer`
4. ![](https://sxcu.net/5BzT3n7WX.png)
5. Inside there, select the folder named `Skyrim Together Reborn`
6. Now find the folder named `config` and enter it.
7. Inside there will be the config file named `STServer.ini`
8. Open that with a text-editor of your choice. In my case I'll use good ol' `Notepad++`.

### **Using Vortex Mod Manager**

2. Go to the `Mods` menu
3. Make sure `Skyrim Together Reborn` is installed and `Enabled`
4. Press `Windows Key + R` and enter this path in the `Run` window:\
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\SkyrimTogetherReborn`
5. In that folder, open the `config` folder
6. In there will be the `STServer.ini` file
7. Open that with a text-editor of your choice. In my case I'll use good ol' `Notepad++`.
