# The STRUI doesn't appear when I press RIGHT CTRL or F2

### Q: The STRUI doesn't appear when I press either `Right CTRL` or `F2`

**A:** First, make sure you've followed this guide from A-Z. Then it shouldn't even happen in the first place. Make sure your `Skyrim Together Reborn` mod folder, with the `SkyrimTogehter.exe`, is located at:\
`C:\Modding\MO2\mods\Skyrim Together Reborn\SkyrimTogetherReborn`

**A:** If the UI does not load, or the screen is covered with white boxes when pressing right control, exit to the main menu and load your save again. If that does not work, try restarting your game until it works.

**A:** Try running SkyrimSE in Windowed mode or Windowed Borderless.

**A:** Try restarting your PC. That has worked for some.

**A:** Make sure your `C:\Modding\MO2\overwrite` folder is empty. If not, then delete everything inside and try again.

**A:** You can try and launch the game using the `skse64_loader.exe`, load your latest savegame and then exit the game. Then go back to MO2 and launch the game using the custom Skyrim Together Reborn launcher, and it should work again.

#### None of that worked for me, what do I do?

**A:** I had the issue myself. The only thing I could do to solve it was do a complete reinstall. Deleting the Skyrim root folder, the `C:\Modding` folder and the `My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` folder - and doing the entire guide again.
