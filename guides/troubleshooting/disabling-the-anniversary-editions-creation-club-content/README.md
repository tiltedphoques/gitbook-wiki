# Disabling the included Creation Club content

{% hint style="info" %}
When Bethesda released the Anniversary Upgrade DLC, the game version was updated to v1.6.

Whether you bought the DLC or not, Bethesda included four Creation Club items with the update.

These four CC items have been shown to make the Skyrim Together Reborn experience more unstable, and prone to crashing more frequently.

This guide will demonstrate how to remove the included CC content using either MO2 or VMM.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you purchased the Anniversary Upgrade DLC, [make sure it is not installed](../../client-setup/initial-setup/launching-the-game.md#making-sure-anniversary-upgrade-dlc-is-disabled) before installing and using the Skyrim Together Reborn mod!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you remove the Creation Club content, your existing savegame(s) may become unloadable.

Regardless, it is **strongly advised** that they be removed!
