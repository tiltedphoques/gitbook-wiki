# Installating the MO2 mod manager

## Installing MO2

Let's get started with installing the mod organizer.

1. Head to [this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files) and press the `Manual Download` button

2\. Open the `Mod Organizer 2-6194-2-4-4-1640622655.exe` file it downloaded. The file name might vary.

3\. Carry on with the installation. Keep the default `C:\Modding\MO2` installation directory. The reason it's not in `Program Files (x86)` is because it's restricted by some standard Windows security features that usually impact negatively on mods, and more specifically the way MO2 works.

4\. So far so good.

#### Onwards to the next step!
