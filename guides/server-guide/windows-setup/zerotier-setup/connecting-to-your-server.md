### How to connect to the server

This page is meant to show the **friend** of the **host** how to connect to his/her server.

#### **Installing ZeroTier**

It's actually pretty simple. We just need to download the ZeroTier client

1. Go to the download page, and select `Windows`.\

#### **Notes:**

1. If you `ALT-TAB` out and back in, it might get stuck. Press either `F2` or `Right-CTRL` to close it and then re-open it again.
2. If it gets stuck, or doesn't want to close or re-open, you might need to restart the game.
3. If your connection times out, make sure you have ZeroTier open, on both the **server host** and on your PC.

### That was it, for the ZeroTier server setup.
