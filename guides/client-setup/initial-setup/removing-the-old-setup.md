# Removing the old setup

### Uninstalling the game

Maybe you haven't even installed Skyrim Special Edition (SkyrimSE), but we'll need to make absolutely sure.

You can start by uninstalling your game in the Steam application:

1. Open Steam
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right click and select `Manage -> Uninstall`
4. Find your Skyrim installation folder. That can vary, but usally it's located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`
5. Delete the entire `Skyrim Special Edition` folder.

### Removing old game profile(s) and savegames

Let's clear out the folder where all **your config files** and **your savegames are**. If you care about these, back them up and replace them later. For now, let's remove them.

1. Go to your `Documents` folder.
2. Find your `My Games` folder.
3. Delete the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder
4. The folder can usually be found at `C:\Users\YOUR-USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition`
5. Obviously replace the `YOUR-USERNAME` part with your own Windows username.

#### **Notes:**

* If you use Steam Cloud, it _should_ automatically upload your savegames to the Steam Cloud. And Steam _should_ re-download them, once you launch SkyrimSE again.
* But if you don't trust Steam Cloud, or not sure if you've enabled it, do a manual backup of the `My Games\Skyrim Special Edition` folder.

### Onwards to the next step!
