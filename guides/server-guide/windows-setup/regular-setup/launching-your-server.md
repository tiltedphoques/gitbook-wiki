# Launching your server

People from outside your local network will be able to access your server now that port forwarding has been completed.

## Launching the server

## [Option 1: Using MO2](launching-your-server.md#using-modorganizer2) | [Option 2: Using VMM](launching-your-server.md#using-vortex-mod-manager)

### Using ModOrganizer2

1. Go to the `Skyrim Together Reborn` folder:\
   `C:\Modding\MO2\mods\Skyrim Together Reborn\SkyrimTogetherReborn`
2. Make sure you've configured your `STServer.ini` with a password
3. Open the `SkyrimTogetherServer.exe`
4. Find your **public IPv4** [here](https://icanhazip.com/) or [here](https://www.whatismyip.net/).
5. Give your friend(s) the public IPv4, and tell them to use that to connect to your server.

6\. If your port forwarding has been successful, they should now be able to connect to your server.



### Using Vortex Mod Manager

## My friends still can't connect to me!

Instead, I recommend trying the [ZeroTier setup](../zerotier-setup/).

Something has most likely gone wrong during the port forwarding process.

#### That was it, for the regular server setup.
