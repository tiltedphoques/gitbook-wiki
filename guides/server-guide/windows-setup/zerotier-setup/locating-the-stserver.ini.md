# Locating the STServer.ini

### Finding the `STServer.ini` to configure our server

Now that our server is closed, and we've created the inbound rules for the firewall, we can take a look at the `STServer.ini` config file, that let's us configure a few parameters.

#### **Locating the `STServer.ini` config file**

1. Open MO2
2. Find the mod `Skyrim Together Reborn`
3. Right-click it, and select `Open in Explorer`
4. ![](https://shx.is/5BzT3n7WX.png)
5. Inside there, select the folder named `Skyrim Together Reborn`
6. Now find the folder named `config` and enter it.
7. Inside there will be the config file named `STServer.ini`
8. Open that with a text-editor of your choice. In my case I'll use good ol' `Notepad++`.
