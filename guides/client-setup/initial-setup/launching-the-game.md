# Launching the game

## Making sure Anniversary Upgrade DLC is disabled

Making sure the Anniversary Upgrade DLC is turned off is a critical step. You may not have purchased it, but it is best to double-check that it is not present:

1. Open Steam and head to your library.
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right-click and select `Properties`
4. Go to `DLC` and **remove** the `âœ“` from the `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade` DLC.
5. If you don't see a DLC tab, it means you didn't buy the `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Upgrade` DLC.

## Launching the game from Steam

Please **do not** skip this step!

Next, we must launch the game normally from Steam in order for it to generate some configuration files for us. Fortunately, this is a very simple procedure.

1. Open Steam and head to your library.
2. Find `The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition`
3. Right-click and select `Launch`
4. The SkyrimSE launcher will open and popup with some detection mechanism that _should_ detect your system and set graphic options accordingly.
5. However, in my situation, it identifies everything incorrectly and sets everything to "Low Quality" and a incorrect resolution.
6. To correct this, go to `Options` and select `Windowed` and `Borderless` to change your resolution.
7. From there just set it up as how you'd like.

8\. Now press `Play` and **EXIT THE GAME** after it has opened into the main menu.
