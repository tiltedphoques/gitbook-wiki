# Initial MO2 setup

## Opening MO2 for the first time

When you first launch MO2, you will see a window titled `Creating an instance`. Take the following steps:

1. Press `Next`
2. Select `Create a portable instance`
3. Select `Skyrim Special Edition` in the list
4. Just confirm the location is `C:\Modding\MO2` and let the `Show advanced button` stay unchecked. No need to fiddle with that.
5. Press `Next`
6. It will prompt you to connect MO2 to your NexusMods account. It is strongly advised that you do so.
7. Press `Connect to Nexus` and it'll open a browser window.
8. This window will appear if you are logged in. If the window does not appear, log in and it will appear. To proceed, press `Authorize`.

9\. This is how the confirmation should look:

> Instance type: Portable
>
> Instance location: C:\Modding\MO2
>
> Game: Skyrim Special Edition
>
> Game location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition

11\. A window titled `Show tutorial?` will appear. Just press `No`. We're skipping that for today.

12\. You'll then be met with another window, titled `Register?`. It's asking you if you want MO2 to handle `nxm` links. And that we do want! So press `Yes`

13\. Now it should look like this, and we're ready for the next step.
