Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is **NOT** required to play Skyrim Together Reborn!

Despite the fact that the mod's name is Address Library for SKSE, we don't actually need SKSE installed.

However, in order for Skyrim Together Reborn to work, we must first install this mod.

## Downloading and installing Address Library

1. Head to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files), find the `All in one (Anniversary Edition)` version and press `Mod Manager Download`
2. ![](https://shx.is/5BiWbFFPM.png)
3. Your MO2 should now launch and download the mod.
4. To the right in MO2, there should be a tab named ![](https://shx.is/5BiX5nxYS.png). Click it!
5. In there will be the mod we just downloaded. Right-click on it and select `Install`
6. ![](https://shx.is/5BiXi9HK3.png)
7. Press `OK` on the popup
8. Press the empty box, so there's a `✓` in the `Address Library for SKSE Plugins`

10. Nice! That should be it for now.

#### Onwards to the next step!
