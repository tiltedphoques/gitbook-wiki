# Configuring ZeroTier network

## Installing ZeroTier

It's actually quite easy. We only need to download and install the ZeroTier client.

1. Go to the download page, and select `Windows`.\

3. There will be no installation prompts or instructions.
4. When it's finished, you should see this ![](https://sxcu.net/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray.

## Joining your network

When we first launch ZeroTier, we need to join your network that we created in the previous step.

1. Find the little ![](https://sxcu.net/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray
2. Right click and select `Join New Network...`\

5. We now need to "authorize" you, which essentially means give you permission to join the network.

#### Onwards to the next step!
