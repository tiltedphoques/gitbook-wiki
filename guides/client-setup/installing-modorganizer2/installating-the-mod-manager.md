# Installating the mod manager

### Installing MO2

Lets go and installing the mod organizer. There are two "big" ones to choose from. Vortex and MO2. In this guide we'll use MO2, since I don't really like the UI in Vortex that much.

1. Head to [this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194?tab=files) and press the `Manual Download` button

2\. Open the `Mod Organizer 2-6194-2-4-4-1640622655.exe` file it downloaded. The file name might vary.

3\. Continue with the install. Keep the default `C:\Modding\MO2` install location. The reason of why it's not in `Program Files (x86)` is because that's locked down by some standard Windows security things that usually messes mods up, and more specifically the way that MO2 works.

4\. So far so good.

### Onwards to the next step!
