Despite the fact that the mod's name is `Address Library for SKSE`, we don't actually need SKSE installed.

However, in order for Skyrim Together Reborn to work, we must first install this mod.

## Downloading and installing Address Library

1. Head to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files), find the `All in one (1.6.X)` version and press `Mod Manager Download`
2. ![](https://i.imgur.com/1gQxsYO.png)
3. Vortex will now launch, automatically downloading and installing the mod.
4. It's that simple!
