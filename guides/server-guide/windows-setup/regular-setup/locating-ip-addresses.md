# Locating IP addresses

## Locating IP addresses

In this step, we'll need to obtain our router's IP address as well as your PC's local IPv4 address. This step must be completed on the PC that will host the Skyrim Together Reborn server.

### **Accessing your router**

1. Before we begin, we must determine how to gain access to our router.
2. Press `Windows Key + R` and write `cmd`
3. With `Command Prompt` open, type `ipconfig /all` and press Enter
4. Look for the `Default Gateway` line and note the IP address.
5. In my case, it's `192.168.50.1`, but the more commonly used are `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.1.1`.
6. Go to the favorite browser of your choice, and enter the IP you've found.
7. You'll most likely be greeted with a login page. If you don't know your login information, this guide can't help you. Typically, the information is physically located on your router, usually on a small white sticker.
8. Login to your router.

## **Before we continue**

1. We need to find our PC's local IPv4 address before we can figure out how to do port-forwarding in our router.
2. To do this, we need to open `cmd` again.
3. Press `Windows Key + R` and write `cmd`
4. With `Command Prompt` open, type `ipconfig /all` and press Enter
5. Look for the `IPv4 Address` line
6. It will show you your **local** IPv4 address. In my case, it's `192.168.50.104`.
7. Make a note of it, copy it, or remember it. It will come in handy later.
