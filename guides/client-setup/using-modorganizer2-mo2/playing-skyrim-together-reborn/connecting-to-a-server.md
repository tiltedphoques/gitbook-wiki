# Connecting to a server

## Using the Skyrim Together Reborn UI (STRUI)

1. Now that we're out of the cave, we want to connect to a Skyrim Together Reborn server.
2. To access the Skyrim Together Reborn UI, press `F2` or `Right-CTRL`. From now on, the guide will refer to it as the `STRUI`.
3. Open up the `STRUI` by pressing either `F2` or `Right-CTRL`.
4. Press the `Connect` button to start connecting to a server

## Connecting to a server

1. When you press connect, you will need to enter your server's connection information.
2. There will be an `Address` field and a `Password` field.
3. In the `Address` field, you should put your server's public IPv4 address in there
4. If you're just hosting it locally, that ip address will be `127.0.0.1`
5. If you're hosting a server for other players, you can find your public IPv4 address by using a website like [this](https://icanhazip.com/) or [this](https://ipinfo.io/) or [this](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
6. Press `Connect` to connect to your server, and there should be a visual and an audial confirmation that you're connected.

7\. It should say `Succesfully connected to a server` in the little chat window

8\. Now you should be connected and ready to play Skyrim Together Reborn with your friends :thumbsup:
