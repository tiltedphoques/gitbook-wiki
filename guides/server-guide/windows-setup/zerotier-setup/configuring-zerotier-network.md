# Configuring ZeroTier network

### Installing ZeroTier

It's actually pretty simple. We just need to download the ZeroTier client

1. Go to the download page, and select `Windows`.\

3. It won't give any installation prompt or instructions.
4. When it's completed, you should now have this ![](https://shx.is/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray.

### Joining your network

We need to join your network, when first launching ZeroTier.

1. Find the little ![](https://shx.is/5BE0DjXJn.png) icon in your system tray
2. Right click and select `Join New Network...` \

5. Now we need to "authorize" you (give you permission to use the network)

### Onwards to the next step!
