# Server setup

## Hosting a server

To host a server, you have two options: you can use a (free) server provider or you can host your own server.

### Third party server hosting

If you decide to go with a server provider, we recommend you go with [playtogether.gg](https://playtogether.gg/) (a free, Skyrim Together specific server hosting website). The setup for server hosting is significantly easier, so consider this option if you are not very handy with computers.
