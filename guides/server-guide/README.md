# Server setup

## Hosting a server

To host a server, you have two options: you can use a (free) server provider or you can host your own server.

### Third party server hosting

If you decide to go with a server provider, we recommend you go with [playtogether.gg](https://playtogether.gg/) (a free, Skyrim Together specific server hosting website). The setup for server hosting is significantly easier, so consider this option if you are not very handy with computers.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Due to the high load of people wanting to play on release day, playtogether.gg might not be available. Use the Hamachi tutorial with the Windows executable for the easiest way to set up a server on your own.
