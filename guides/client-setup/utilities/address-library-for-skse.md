# Address Library for SKSE

We'll need the Address Library mod for Skyrim Together Reborn to work.

### Downloading and installing Address Library

1. Head to the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files), find the `All in one (Anniversary Edition)` version and press `Mod Manager Download`
2. ![](https://shx.is/5BiWbFFPM.png)
3. Your MO2 should now launch and download the mod.
4. To the right in MO2, there should be a tab named ![](https://shx.is/5BiX5nxYS.png). Click it!
5. In there will be the mod we just downloaded. Right-click on it and select `Install`
6. ![](https://shx.is/5BiXi9HK3.png)
7. Press `OK` on the popup
8. Press the empty box, so there's a `✓` in the `Address Library for SKSE Plugins`

10. Nice! That should be it for now.

### Onwards to the next step!
