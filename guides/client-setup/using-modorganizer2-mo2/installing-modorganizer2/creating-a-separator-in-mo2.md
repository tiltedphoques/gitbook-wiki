# Creating a separator in MO2

In MO2, we will now create a separator. This is useful for getting a sense of your setup.

The only function is to distinguish mods from one another. It's like having your own categories.

We'll only make one separator because we only need one mod, beyond the Skyrim Together Reborn mod itself.

However, if you want to add more separators to sort other mods, you can do so.

## Creating a separator

1. Open MO2
2. Make sure to select the profile "Skyrim Together Reborn" that we created earlier.

4. Right-click in some empty area below the mods, and select `Create separator`
5. Name it `Utilities` and press Enter.

#### Onwards to the next step!
