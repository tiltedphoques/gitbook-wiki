### Overview

Here will be an overview of the different guides and approaches to setting up a server.

The Windows one will have a few more options than Linux. Simply because the easiest thing to do on Linux, is to use Docker.

Choose only **one** of the options, whatever suits you the best.

### Windows

#### **Regular server setup (with port forwarding)**

This guide will go through setting up a server on your Windows PC, using nothing but Windows. There will be no additional software, beyond MO2. I would only choose this option, if you're comfortable with port forwarding and/or have done it many times before.

#### **Using ZeroTier server setup (without port forwarding)**

This guide will go through setting up a server on your Windows PC, using ZeroTier.

### Linux

#### **Using Docker (with portforwarding)**

This guide will go through setting up a server on your Linux PC, using Docker.

In this guide, only the Linux terminal will be used.
