5. Write `Host` in the `(short-name)` field
6. Write `Host of the Skyrim Together Reborn server` in the `(description)` field
7. Most importantly: Press the `Auth?` checkbox to allow the user to connect to you.

## What IP address should I send to my friend?

1. You should use the Managed IP, which is next to the Host field.
2. In my case, that's `10.244.150.2`.
3. This is the IP address you would use to connect to Skyrim Together Reborn (STRUI).
