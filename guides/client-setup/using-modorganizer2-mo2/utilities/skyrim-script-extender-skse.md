# Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)

Now we are going to get SKSE installed. This we will have to do manually.

It's pretty easy and straightforward!

## Downloading SKSE

1. Before we begin, **please close your MO2 instance!**
2. Head to [this website](https://skse.silverlock.org/) and download the `Anniversary Edition` version of SKSE
3. Look at the picture below if it doesn't make sense

5. Open the `skse64_2_01_05.7z`
6. Inside the archive will be a main folder, named `skse64_2_01_05`. Double click on that to enter it.
7. You need to extract the following folders and files:\
   `Data`\
   `src`\
   `skse64_1_6_353.dll`\
   `skse64_loader.exe`\
   `skse64_steam_loader.dll`\
   To the SkyrimSE root/install folder: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`
8. If you head to your SkyrimSE root folder, it should look like this now:

## Running Skyrim with SKSE

Just be sure it works, let's launch SKSE now manually.

1. Head to your SkyrimSE root folder again:\
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`
2. Open the `skse64_loader.exe` and Exit Skyrim after the main menu has loaded.

#### Onwards to the next step!
